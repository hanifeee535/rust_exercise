    Rust Vectors:

    - A vector is a growable, contiguous collection of elements of the same type.
    - Vectors are similar to arrays, but they can dynamically resize when elements are added or removed.
    - They are stored on the heap, so their size doesnâ€™t need to be known at compile time.

    Vector Structure:
    - Vec<T>: A vector holding elements of type T.
    - Elements are stored in contiguous memory, which makes access by index very fast.

    Creating a Vector:
    - Using the `vec!` macro: let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    - Using Vec::new(): let mut v = Vec::new();
      Then push elements: v.push(4);

    Accessing Elements:
    - By index: v[0]
    - Using .get(): v.get(2)

    Iterating through Vectors:
    - With a for loop
    - Using iterators and methods like .map() or .filter()
